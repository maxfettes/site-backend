# Fragment


Peaceful crossing the road is easy with the shops unlit on order from the popehead. Don't want Pauly not a lick and not polluted not through gas if not the grid is coal. Ivory tower dome, do the blessed nuns and monks all live it up together? Sacre-coeur! Activity then. From building mess to mass, and shields are up in solid white. Thought black but who's who and christ what colour. Dirty white are the pillars, arches and entablature. And it was an erection over London then, and mustered up grandest for an epoch and a sage. Look at this fast food opposite, slick. Just slap and poke the bubble till it bursts. And let the rat run loose inside. Em, can't get in edgeways without the ebony rosary gold plated crucifix? Supporting chapters or red cross affiliations: the receiving kind as always. 
Giant parks against a floodlit face and straight rock. Do not take anything for granite. Rick said don't take it for granite and he'd never seen the polished nipple up to Dog before. Rick would also unzip at the chapel door and release not politics over the cityscape. Original speculation right, and not about tulips sake, not stalks or stubs;
INVEST IN THE AFTERLIFE
Hey you, hey there. Give yours to us, make incessant prayers. Family obligations? No time to waste! For family capitals on the day of death, and you'll ascend. Think of futures, and options for humanity, and help us market out the one true doctrine. Passed through and linearly active straight from Jésus lord and saviour street. The one who died to let you walk upon the culmination of misty hallways of our modestly infinite estate in the sky. Villa of blue, for only a token of you, a share that lets you and us and them appreciate the wealth of all Valhalla. This sacrament to the angels shows that we don't live in squalor now. Help welcome them into the Eucharist, our table, and participate in the body of the Son and know our house is worthy of reciprocation. And they will invite us up into the corridors of our ancestors residence. Who advanced from physical into spiritual beings, walking with the saints and almighty ancient minds. Walk towards your judgement day with confidence that you've given all you could and you'll know that this is yours. That here you've built this house, for this is the home of the eternal free. Do not walk away from this once in a lifetime opportunity. There is no beyond your means. You are the means, and we want you. Run and your eternity will be spent in trenches of the searing spit beneath the sewers of Saint Paul. Give into the house which you desire to hold, or turn forever from it's sacred doors into the unknown and the sin. Until you are ready to repent, and to give up giving up and thus retreat back from the simple sins of insolence and sardony and grin. 
Ah, sire. Beyond a reasonable shake and granted splash of good Israeli kak. What’s not to love and what’s not to hate? Well, the avenues of history, litter bugs galore. Dropping game on blocks, whips to make the unskilled smarter. So what’s a rack, except for sanitation wrong and where’s the moral line? Real question. What is vandalism on the raped and stolen land, built up to museum quality testaments to the powerful elite? So ask what’s the difference between man and god, and what’s the difference of bitches? One’s got public and private, one’s got inside and out. Sums of privates and the randy gauging inner children’s shouts.  Giant does pull out and leaves a stink behind and to the true pit, the hole of man’s kindness to itself. That dodged the face of labour for a tax, that breaks the rules of people and found the loops to circumnavigate. Who stopped one tyrant and let two more enter at each other’s throats. They had been allies killing off the third. 
Yes bank is it for the bank. In those days was it just one bank or of the riverbank? Dealing with deposits, what's the difference? Accumulation of one kind or another. The underground’s the same, and not just Bakerloo line spider crossroads. Bank which is liquid non-newtonian and a financial centre deals with liquidity and there’s the difference: riverbeds (and associated banks) still hold on to the viscose and the fluid. Tide, shore, buoyancy, 
depth, spread the universe applicable to a range of different inconsistencies. The liquid surface moves slick and reads the moon for speed and cubic deliveries. The sludge deeper to the bed of the river is the stationary home of urban low oxygenated monsters. Crawdads and eels dominate the darkness underneath the Thames. Good for body disposal, good for a scary story and that could be all it is. But don’t bank on it for jives sake and don’t swim where you can't see your hands dipped underneath the surface, don’t dive if you cannot see the bottom, and don’t fly if you can afford to take the train. The rush of stock liable to move little in a day and nought that you could help. The reliability of a red lion is about as worthless as guessing to the mm what the level of the tide will be tomorrow. Still, it would be but a club past Islington and penthouses brimming on and on. Pubs that don’t close need a different breed and some folk never.
Giant on the railing all horseshoe locked and strapped down. ONSON, full PPE place not easy sneakings over corporate walls and slippery paint enclosure. Sahi foot up will ya, get a buckle on this; a trick, mongrel pup can’t or instant incessant half cut rascal man with head half on and half litre wad and loved up swollen everything and there can Sahi sahi. Whatcha doin’ hah can climb up drain pipes, whip round tight corners, slimline, beeline, couldn’t find the line to not cross but just a look. Just have a look it’s not closed, a bit close must be. Have a look just scenes closed and topped off too and can’t cannot no can you nail the desks to floors and can’t glue lamps to post-it notes on sturdy standing desks. No, you can’t put this kid in a cage and say it’s life, no not with that hair and a kirby not. Put that beautiful girl on a bus pumping headphones in and tell her these three daily hours are just a part of life and don’t say well that’s three days each month, and what’s your weekend plans? Sit sat on the deck of the 159, sitting on the desk or whatever. Sitting got a special seat too - butt shaper and a foot rest, and top gel hand and wrist holster - got that in the zone type space set up. But who knows interior designer, upper management, directors could be radical and have you standing up, and mandatory office jogs. 
DISCRIMINATION
Can’t happen won’t happen. Arses happening all day, and arses clapping and happy cramping. Kushy, maybe got it wrong and skid lore upping stairs will be a shops and cafe matrix. A school gymnasium would fit inside the foyer, each child a desk, each class a team, each teacher a quote, each rector a goal. Little office university and get paid while getting laid. Amazing results when we’re done with the pigs. Let’s keep the buildings and don’t roark it up to the imperfect hall. It’s the dogs that have to go at the end. Incorporated space for bulls and bears. Just one percent in the fire pit that’s easy, maybe bottom one percent too and be fair, and another one percent at each ten bracket, nice. Let’s keep it top and repeat and repeat until subordinates get the picture beat. Choose life, sweatshop catalyst, have new jeans. Having mon-fri socks with a new fresh smell is best. So fresh for footrest and waning gibbous waxing crescent sneakers. January to February spring, summer, autumn socks and boots, flip-flops, crocs, ticks and smocks on corners own spot matching headband stocks - but old docs, old docs from the store are old docs. Each matches mismatched, must have the pairs as odd and not and hats to match and spectrum jackets. 
What about music, that’s a brand, and Beiber, that’s a statement coming from a man who’s fully grown. But I’m a believer in tit for tat and stripes on plain shirt pockets and plaid cuffs and bleached denim ripped to super cool. Uber. But they’re coming out closed steel toe in to stick desires and brewhime, timed to ruddy up and keep sitting. Ollie, Charlie, Alex, Keiran, John, Peter, Amanda, Craig, Stephen, Pritchard; you got it slacks on powder jeans on site and sweaty shirts off and sweatshirts on and turtlenecks and chinos, loafers brown and blue, adidas iridescent and blue gazelles, and silver seikos and gold plated casios and swatches,
- lads, first rounds on me lads, what are we, eight, boys? sorry, boys and lady that’s nine so what nine lagers and a shandy is it. Outstanding. Craig, see us a hand with the tray, mate
A LITTLE LATER
- smashing tits, fucking hell.
Anyway Tuesday is not a heavy one and some pores stay open more than other ones and fashion in its own way is the prolet chic. Even the one’s got out the dust and can’t shake the gloves and hard hats, clean hard hats and new boots, and clean shirts under special visors. Architect’s an abstract thing, can’t be too much more than formwork, for the amount of folk you’ll hire. Formwork design - that’s concrete. But the fitters, fixers, fetchers and fat arses. Haven’t seen such since a few holidays and they gather all around. 
- Gather round, SANTA CLAUS has an announcement to make!
stand up, stand up
- Hello, everyone, happy to be here. Berg, Baum, Birchen, Bilde - families I would like to have died for if I didn’t have the choice. Let me say...
beads of sweat are forming, trickling and wiped off slow off reddish forehead
- ...just a…
(beat)
- ...just a little tale and boys and young ladies, wives, husbands, free loaders and hard talkers, 
(beat) 
sisters, siblings, aunts, nephews, friends of friends that have gathered here today...just going to lift my leg up for a little dramatic effect...nothing to worry about...I…
And that was Zachman Belvir and his annual farting joke where he stands up and makes sure everyone is listening in before dessert and aperitif. A mock speech and tremendous, and let’s tell you tremendous Hanukkah. But no-one knows if it was a problem of digestion or diet that brought on such a deep and perspiring scarlet face this one festival of lights and we could tell that Zach felt it was close, but he could hardly concentrate on the harangue and instead started practically swelling up into a ripe old lobster - fat and succulent and not much more jovial and saintly, but piggy and a little bit frightening to behold. The stuttering at the end of his personal tradition had Dr. Brimberg MD, and Prof. Salumnt, PhD Cardiology, edge away from the backs of their seats and really start to analyse the old fart. Was this a simple trapped gas situation and discomfort? Shutting down the body completely in order to pin down a deadly burp. Or, which is probable taking Mr. Belvir’s history of public speaking and extreme lack of embarrassment for him or his children, and who does not ever stammer without a deliberate comic effect, had more likely some erratic palpitations and a long resting blockade of certain arteries pinpointing a couple of troubled limbs and Zach Belvir dropped much quicker than a sack of potatoes with eyes on the back of his head, and legs more wobbly than the jelly he has for breakfast. This great weight crashing to the floor was almost completely unanticipated, and completely shocking, startling indeed. The show man hit the ground in a loud and muffled garumph and must have shaken his insides as his loosened body let out one final raspberry, biting the attention of every wide eyed in the room and setting off a literal earthquake inside. An earthquake situated, it is to be believed, around a fairly eruptive volcano which is well known to diffuse large amounts of sulphur into the air, but will really require a deft rattling to really blast off and make the front page. Zach, unlike Sahi, does only need to collapse in voluptuous ear splitting and nose pinching death rattle to wind up as the poorest but also and rarely most heroic schmuck of the week, at least on a couple of locals only papers. Luckily for Zachary, you can quite easily lose ten years and twenty kilograms in an obituaries profile. 
Now anyway, what’s a place like this doing without an alarm system to say the least and no CCTV on the inside and even for a lockpick this seems too fancy. And you could say steel girders and beams are a bit tricky to steal but here the concern is sabotage and not theft. A place of any kind of place can be a ripe old spot for auld tricks and if you listen to a poltergeist then be spooked and if you entertain the thought of foul play you must be a madam or a spook or a psychoanalyst. Luckily an act of Dog is inexplicable and is the perfect antidote for the budding over analyst. The land of the accidental and microsevere. There’s just a bit of scaffold and a DO NOT ENTER sign blocking certain paths, but without end or tiers and strict walkers asking air scold and permits for ladders. Red card for mostly anything that’s done and can’t be seen in the day and who could tell by finding a sneaker print on silica must be one youth and if there were one there were two and even if an inquiry was held well who could be sacked and who could be suspected.

HOLDEN CAULFIELD MADE ME DO IT
in the canteen might get their attention. But that kind of monster youth is that which already outspells the foreman, outfucks the engineer and is a fox as far as causing damage and couldn’t find the whisky anyway. That’s youth not a thief or a pagen.
But there is an assortment of biscuits in the site directors desk and every fifth is laced with the dabbiest of drops and that is colourless and odourless and makes the trees sway even on the stillest days. It’s really the little things that make a world of difference to a day, and maybe a small dose makes you light and a cool kid with a wide grin and pupils half way into next week and clammy hands, might dry his up. But bloodshot eyes and verging on tears on a very unlit and please remain dark and fully grown and dick swingers will embark. And sharing is caring oh i had and cherry pie didn’t put my Fingers in at 160° no I didn’t fuck it not me or nobody minds or half a mind to but don’t mind either or either pitch on watching the man spiked clothes off looking at the sky (blue) and singing famous Leonard Cohen songs and then be Jesus and pulling in the power of 10,000 Jesus’ And ain’t seeing triangular warning as funny singers and a crew who just think forever you are as mad as hell and Hell to Damm well just taking that anymore. And kestrel call Okeefe Went out by the cigarette smokers to embrace sunlight, ripping off his checkers and banging gorilla on a surprising, though situationally fitting, hairy chest. And his green eyes and freckles go pore to follicle in Finnigans likeness and it would be correct to say that the sweater and scarf match complexion, so it is. This is may seem inevitable by now, has produced 98% of a Boehner fired the jungle man, who evidently makes the same realisation himself and starts climbing up the scaffold. This is totally out of procedure for the large belly the mammal, and sites own director of operations, who, by the way, was a Sparky and there is never so much as lifted a corner bracket, let alone being in the monkeying around of trying to put the whole thing together. “Crack” Caliban clipWas duly called into action while Simpson steel first wrote up the hazard form. Crackhead on his harness, and another over his shoulder, and carrabinaded himself to the bar over his head preparing for the climb when Sim gave him the bright idea of catching him at the third floor. Crack, as rank or West only knows him, follows up the stairs with slacks on his shoulders, ready to strap the fat cat. By the time that crack could cut the kestrel off, he’d already started a king Kong on level four and I was stroking his little strawberry blonde friend and cooling peacefully, balanced precariously above the plastic shell of the scaffold, in an extremely tentative and overconfident squad. Crack, clambering from the floor below and lineup with the precious beast. He was quite excited by the prospect of last doing the director and tried carefully to work up without startling him. As crack Caliban got within a couple of metres he could hear the infantile chance clearly; a 
rhythmic stream of nonsense incantations. The director was beating up Richard. Crack could find no angle in, and started to become frightened. There was no scene point of M entry, and so he retreated a little and called out softly to the director. And Orangutang looks down to the human form climber. Remain completely still and two pairs of eyes locked, absolutely. Crack pulls out a small bunch of bananas from his toolbelt and hold one out. Still no movement, but eyes move between the bananas and the silent  uproarious eyes. Crack knows his way around a druggie, but psychedelics are not his usual 40. Nevertheless, he is patient and careful to try and bring the savage in sons escalation. And escalations is such circumstances must be extreme in the absolute farce. A man thinks he is before man, and not the superman, who can be tempted with the challenge and not treats not beneath man who will grab on every charity willing. The little scaffolder knows now that it was going to be tricky and set his mind on the safe recovery of Captain Okeefe. He edge towards the supervisor, Simeon impose, with a banana outstretched and I is locked. The muscle memory of a decade is dead slow motion does not let Okeefe kestrel to think he has any more swinging antics to go. The director weights with caution for a crack to get within arm reach, and snatches of bananas out of his hand. Crack balances itself inside the eighth and fasten some self to the bar, holding out the rest of the fruit kestrel caught Okeefe opens the bananas by squeezing them in slurping up the fruit into his puckered mouth. He takes the rest of the bunch happily and squeeze than one by one into his mouth. The crane and chains are edging slowly down above the pair. The Corporal crack Caliban still doesn’t have good innings. He opens up the harness. As kestrel takes the penultimate banana, he’s on wittingly putting his arm right through the harness, which crack plans on strapping to him like a waistcoat. Crack claims around the back of kestrel and looks down at the director from the opposite side, offering another banana through the left hip of the harness. Crack, daft, carabiners the back to the two ton strap hanging just above the dangling from the crane, and before that Director has time to notice, the front class has been clicked and fastened and he has been lifted up above the scaffolding. Intelligently, the beast does not thrash, and looks in fear of the fine drop below him, keeping a cool and trim fusion on the harness. The crane move sideways and begins to lower the director onto a pallet to drop on the fourth floor. Crack is almost there already and he meets Simpson still fast at the LSE to congratulate each other on completion of the safe recovery. The recently active director is becoming door sale perhaps in realisation but probably a simple after fees snap hits him and greet them on the landing without fuss but sitting cross-legged on the planks while Sim and crack unhooked the crane and cover the jig lemon in a blanket and asks if he will stand up. Unfortunately it is the weekend, and there aren’t any biscuits to drug. Moreover there are no drugs and there is only a memory of intoxication and unspent fantasy of the future. Credit card clicks into the offices and papers shuffled sufficiently enough to cause say site wide confusion. It is true that getting into the main blueprints will be problematic, but a little panic will be at least set in motion the search for answers, and maybe even a silent into office witchhunt. If he he kept his head on lower and thicker he would be the luckier and have nothing to do with the piping. There is also the free space, the air pockets of bad architecture. We are back to the original point of obstruction free architecture when arriving into the realm of plaster and wiring. It is only a hotel, the worst kind of extravagance to be worth 1 billion. Imagine that, a room of one’s own without life. The ready meal of habitat they’re away from home and wife away from strife. Paper copy is located and building under budding mental siege. Capturing a great weight in a small space is a fantastically useful skill. It doesn’t matter if you were a basketball Player for the banks men, to be able to hit the Bullseye in a tight spot translates to almost all facets of life. It’s only grateful all the lovers of 

snooker players for the key and ability to take a queue hold it for extended periods concentrated strength and release of the precision of baskets that are many may seem a huge distance. This analogy comes from someone an issue uninitiated in the inner workings of an orgasm and presumably thinks that relationships are very scientific affairs not to be making jokes about chemistry and psychology which are only to the same date scientific explanation of phenomena. Phenomena on the other hand is another art all within itself and although an ordinary plosive utterance may make the art of cunnilingus, one would imagine that the soft palate communications (normally utilising the tongue) is a better alternative to phallic oral vernacular. Phallic oral vernacular, known in the world of embraced sexuality simply as POV, is the sensitive skill, both contributing to the chemistry, and the psychology of sex. Here you whisper such explicit expletive is as GET on your whore face I’m going to fuck you like a dirty bitch and don’t make a sound fuck you what’s your name resulting in the adrenaline gland supercharging both parties erotic experience and similarly increases the energy and tolerance what a place thinking sexy thinking what have I been missing and what a nice head of hair and nice looking too and handsome two are not poor not rich and only calling close friends bitch and I am ironic to say he they won’t ever do a DNA here not for this it’s just a practical joke for a man to man and man this happens all the time. But whose desk, director? Won’t go back there again and the managers to smarted I’d pull it right out of you the next time we saw you he be dam sharp and prepared he try and make friends with a lot of us just to crack it. Tripping us up on any random occasion leading us to the
