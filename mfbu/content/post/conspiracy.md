# 'A picnic in a park.'

The cruelty you need to place upon the PM in proposing that this is a part of a political blueprint is so great that I cannot take you seriously anymore. From this point onwards I am a non-believer. It was a relatively short stretch when the concensus attracted delusions of an orchestrated nightmare. A concesus, that is, or rather voices of the charged and opinionated minorty. 

  Despite a previously superficial contradiction wherein I stated that society needs to do away with the deviant in order to guarantee the coming of the guardian, it should have been expanded upon how these traits remain relevant today, and in what bracket this character inhabits. It is clear that what is based upon a regime of military training, supplemented by the cultivation of the mind, has become an intellectual pursuit, further enhanced by the nourishment of the body. I hope it does not appear careless, when I say that our current and future guardians must be first the defenders of an idea, before they give defence to the unconditional grip of the past, and the familiar present. It was never explicitly stated which reined supreme; that of might over mind or vice versa. My contention is that it is specific to a time. If your enemy is your neighour, you must be Heraclean. If that enemy is in the air and the language; essentially empowered by the encounters of civilised existence, then your hero is in medicine, and in communication. 

  Only by imagining that the thing you are fighting against is the very body which has been employed to assist you, will you take up corporeal protest, using bodies to stand for absolute transparency, and retention of individual value. By focusing on theory, the defence can be introduced, ingested, expanded and iterated upon with fantastic efficiency. A debate can either be encouraged, or feared. A government can either be thought of as absolute in its corruption, or as a collection of wins and losses; success conducted for the few, or for the whole. 

  I am afraid I have done little justice to the argument in favour of trust towards our leaders. So I will end on a definitive note, hopelessly devoid of my cryptic effervesance: The day you believe that any person can manipulate you, by using the lives of millions of people to instill loyalty to them, you are in a hell so deep, that thrashing will only cause the sink to be that much more irreversible.
