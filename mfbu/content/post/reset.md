As we cross over the anniversary of COVID (for me born sometime during the Tết 2020 holidays, aka lunar new year), I want to start sharing my ideas for the new age. This blog will act as an inquiry into those ideas, and a space for them to grow.

If you thought you could skip the years between idealogical discovery and social implementation, you have already contributed to the downfall of humankind. If you thought that the world is autonomous in its journey towards absolute consciousness and interdependent benevolence, you have already given up on any possibility of achieving this.

Some of us are working hard to keep the power in the hands of the few; some are trying to foster equality and total power within the individual – there is a spectrum of idealists from the rainbow pastel to the whitewash. Everybody else lives within the bubble which has been assigned to them. Everybody else is either content and incredulous, or discontent and incredulous.

Here Comes Everybody. Now, what do you have to say for yourself
